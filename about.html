    <p>Simply put, League of Legends is an online MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) where players battle each other using in-game champions. With hundreds of different champions available in game, players must work together with their teammates in order to defeat the other team.</p>
    <p>This requires skill, strategy and lots of teamwork!</p>
    <p>To summarize a MOBA for you, 5 players on each team join an arena that consists of 3 lanes. Each lane has minions that spawn and travel down the lane until they meet the enemies minions in the middle. Each team has 3 towers in each lane followed by an inhibitor which leads into your base. Inside your base is a Nexus guarded by 2 more towers. For a team to win they must destroy the other team's Nexus or make the other team surrender.</p>
    <p>The developers behind the League of Legends game are Riot Games who are often simply referred to as Riot. Founded in 2006 by 2 guys Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill, the company began working on League of Legends in 2008 and has now spent over 10 years developing and improving the game.</p>
    <p>Before League of Legends was first launched there were hardly any MOBA games on the market. In fact, the only one that people played was the original Defense of the Ancients which was a third-party mod for the popular Warcraft 3 game.</p>
    <p>After playing the game for a while, the 2 founders of Riot saw the potential for it to be developed into a stand-alone. Jump 10 years into the future and League of Legends is by far the biggest MOBA game out there. With lots of other competitors joining the market such as Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm and Paragon, League of Legends is still number 1.</p>
    <p>Today Riot Games is a huge billion dollar company that has thousands of employees working on developing and improving the game. The game makes money just like a lot of other MOBA games, by selling in-game items and power-ups that players can use.</p>
    <p>With so much competition from other games, how has League of Legends risen to the top to be the number 1 MOBA? Itâ€™s all about the gameplay.</p>
