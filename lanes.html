        <p>When it comes to League of Legends roles, the tank is often the most underestimated. Most people think of tanks as slow champion that doesn’t do any damage. That might be true, but they are an important member of the team. Not only do they soak up damage from other champions but they also help crowd control and stun the enemies ADC.</p>
        <p>The tank will likely be the only person on the team that will have the defenses and crowd control to get to the ADC without dying. Once they make it to the ADC it’s their job to stun, snare and disrupt them as much as possible so they can’t deal damage. Your teams ADC and APC will then move in to secure the kill.</p>

    <div class="jungle">
        <h1>Jungle</h1>
        <img src="assets/Lanes/Jungle.jpg">
        <p>Since there are only 3 lanes on summoner’s rift and 5 players, there has to be a player who plays in the jungle. This is done for a number of reasons. The first is that by having someone in the jungle utilizing the jungle camps, they can gain XP without having to share it with other players.</p>
        <p>If 2 players decided to go top lane but the enemy team only had 1 player there, after a while there would be a significant level difference. This is because XP is split between champions in the area. So by having a player in the jungle not only allows other players to get the full XP from their lanes, but the jungler also gets maximum XP.</p>
        <p>The second reason for having a jungler is to help support other lanes. Naturally, the jungler will have to move from camp to camp in order to kill creatures and get XP. This requires a lot of roaming and running around. A lot of the time the jungler will pass a lane in order to get to another jungle camp. While passing, the jungler can assist the lane with pushing minions or trying to gank the enemy laner.</p>
        <p>Because of this, most junglers are highly mobile, have huge gap closers and can deal tons of damage.</p>

    <div class="mid_lane">
        <h1>Mid Lane</h1>
        <img src="assets/Lanes/Mid_Lane.jpg">
        <p>Similar to the ADC (attack damage carry) on your team, the APC (ability power carry) is capable of dealing a lot of damage. However, unlike the ADC the APC doesn’t require support from other champions. Instead, they play on their own in order to get the maximum XP as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>Also unlike ADCs, APC do most of their damage with their abilities instead of auto attacks. This gives APC’s something called “burst damage” the ability to do a lot of damage in a short space of time.</p>
        <p>Mid laners play an important role throughout the stages of the game. As the name suggests, mid laner means they play in the mid lane. We’ll get more into which lane each roles plays, but for now, it’s important to know the APC is usually found in the mid lane. Not only does this allow the player to get maximum XP on their own, but it also gives them great “roamability”.</p>
        <p>This means if the top or bottom lane need help, the mid lane is available to help if the jungler has died or is preoccupied. Having another player on your team that can roam to different lanes can substantially increase your gank potential.</p>

    <div class="bot_lane">
        <h1>Bot Lane</h1>
        <img src="assets/Lanes/Bot_Lane.jpg">
        <p>One of the most popular League of Legends roles in game is the marksman. Also known as the ADC (attack damage carry), the marksman is responsible for dishing out serious damage. Who doesn’t want to impress their friends with a penta-kill?</p>
        <p>The primary role of the marksman is to kill the other team’s marksman, as well as their entire team. In order to do this, the marksman will need very high damage output including a high crit chance. The downside of the marksman is that they are often very squishy since they only build offensive items. This means if they get caught by the bruiser or jungler they will often die. In order to survive in lane and acquire enough gold to become powerful enough, they require support from another player on their team.</p>
        <p>This is where the support comes in.</p>
        <p>The support on your team will primarily be in the same lane as your marksman / ADC. Their role in the lane will be to help protect, sustain and support the ADC. This means sacrificing their life, hitpoints and gold to ensure the ADC stays alive as long as possible, and gets the most kills.</p>
        <p>Most support champions will be fully equipped with crowd control effects such as stuns, slows, snares, silences and knock ups. All of these are to be used against the enemy to ensure your ADC can secure a kill.</p>
        <p>Another important part of the support role is providing vision for your team. Everyone hates spending money on wards, but you need them if you want to win.</p>
